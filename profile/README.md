## About Mario Kart Tour 7

MKT7 is a Mario Kart 7 mod which features Mario Kart Tour content to make the game feel
more like how MKT could have been. That's why we do our best to make the mod look the
best we can. This mod will include custom karts, characters, tires and gliders.

Future content might prove that there will be more to this mod.

## Contribution Guidelines

We appreciate any help we can get. However, follow these simple rules, so we don't need to have a bad time.

- **Be constructive.** Messages like "it doesn't work" or similar are useless. When reporting bugs or crashes, please give us some context, such as providing a good picture of the crash screen (if it exists), the version of MK7 you use, where the bug occured (launcher or in-game) as well as if you have made any changes to the mod.
- **When making pull requests, check what you're about to submit.** It's better to take time with translations and fixes than to rush and end up with a terrible result, which could include nasty bugs.
- **Hate, spam and other obstructive messages are not tolerated.** This can cause your issue/pull request to get rejected. Repeated offenses will cause in you losing the ability to contribute to this modpack.

You will get credited when your contribution was successful.
